# **Stage 2 - A simple CRUD Api written in PYTHON.**

## **Description**

This API is written in the Python programming language, and uses SQLALchemy as the object -relational mapper (ORM), Marshmallow as the serializer and deserializer, and SQLite as the database.

It allows a user to create a person, find a person, update a person and also delete a person's data from the database.
The project's entry point is app.py.

## **API Documentation**

The API is fully documented, and can be found [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29597896/2s9YC4VtXE).

## Testing

Unit tests/feature tests were not part of the requirements, but from the API docs in the link above, you will be able to test it on Postman.
The API is deployed to [robinsonuche.onrender.com](https://robinsonuche.onrender.com/api)

## **Known Limitations and Assumptions**

This API assumes that person records are uniquely identified by their user_id.
The API uses a SQLite database for simplicity. In a production environment, a more robust database solution should be considered.
Error responses are standardized but can be further customized to meet specific requirements.
